# Physics Calculations in Processing

This project represents my first approach to **physics calculations** in computers using **Processing** for the course **Physics in Video Games** during my first year of university.

### About the Project

The goal of this project was to explore the fundamentals of physics simulations and how they can be implemented in a programming environment. This experience helped me understand the principles of physics and their applications in game development.

### Features
- Basic physics simulations using Processing.
- Exploration of fundamental physics concepts.
- Designed as part of the Physics in Video Games course.

### Technologies
- **Processing**
